    <h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
    Using the core rules from RuneQuest II, Legend is a new fantasy roleplaying game that serves as the basis for a multitude of settings and worlds. 100% compatible with all previous RuneQuest II books, including Elric of Melnibone, Deus Vult and Wraith Recon, Legend repackages the rules into a new digest-sized format.<br><br>
    RPG fans will not be dissappointed in the attention lavished on the new game. In particular they can expect:<br><br>
    A streamlined and revised character creation system, with greater emphasis on character background, but also significant changes that influence a character's starting skills and abilities and the speed with which adventurers develop, improve and progress. Particular attention has been paid to training and skill improvement, but you will also find that the structure and range of skills is greatly enhanced, meaning that new adventurers begin with a greater degree of competence across the board. <br><br>
    Although all the familiar concepts remain (Combat Actions, Strike Rank and so forth), the combat process is based on simple rolls, does not rely on any resolution matrix, and introduces special Combat Manoeuvres simulating the cut and thrust of real combat whilst offering a truly epic, cinematic edge. Combat is faster than before an perhaps more deadly, but every character will find a greater range of tactical options and combat effects that create a satisfying, exciting, combat flow. <br><br>  
    The presentation of the game rules has been restructured to make it easier for Games Masters and players to find what they need, when they need it. The system is designed with clarity and ease of use in mind.<br><br>
    Great pains have been taken to ensure full backwards compatibility with RuneQuest II. All RuneQuest II books and expansions remain compatible with Legendand, indeed, material presented in earlier editions has become the foundation for the new game.<br><br>
    So, it is with great pride that we bring you Legend; a new take on a classic system, assembled by designers and writers who have more than 50 years of RuneQuest experience between them.
